<p><strong>Current Science</strong> is a multidisciplinary journal and therefore research and review papers of general significance that are written clearly and well organized will be given preference. All papers, solicited and unsolicited, will be first assessed by a Reviewing Editor. Papers found unsuitable in terms of the overall requirements of the journal will be returned to the authors. The others will be sent for detailed review. Authors of these papers will be notified of acceptance, need for revision or rejection of the paper. It may be noted that papers once rejected cannot be resubmitted. Illustrations and other materials to be reproduced from other publications must be properly credited; it is the authors’ responsibility to obtain permission for reproduction of figures, tables, etc. from published sources (copies of letters of permission should be sent to the editor).</p>

<h4>Declarations to be made regarding ethical issues</h4>
<p>Manuscripts that deal with clinical findings should be enclosed with a statement on informed consent of the patients under study.</p>
<p>If humans and animals are the subject of a clinical study, it is essential for the study to have been carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the country/countries where the research described in the article has been conducted. A declaration to that effect must accompany the manuscript.</p>

<h4>Supplementary material</h4>
<p>Detailed tables can be submitted as supplementary material, which will be published online. If tables with huge data are not submitted as supplementary material and are found suitable for online publishing only, the discretion to use these as supplementary material lies with the journal. The authors will be informed about this during the processing of their manuscripts.</p>
<p>Any details and queries regarding supplementary material should be addressed to the corresponding author of the paper. The published material cannot be reproduced without permission from the author.</p>

These include interdisciplinary topics, science policy and science administration, some aspects of the application of science and technology to human needs or the impact of science and technology on society/ecosystems/life. The articles should include an abstract, introductory paragraph, brief subheads at appropriate places, illustrations that will help a general reader, and references.</p>

<h4>Review articles</h4>

<h4>Research accounts</h4>
<p>Research accounts (not exceeding 6000 words, cited references to be limited to about 60 in number) are articles intended to be personalized reviews of research from the author(s)’ laboratory, based on a body of published work. The articles must provide appropriate background to the area in a concise introduction, which should also serve to place the author(s)’ work in a proper perspective.</p>

<h4>Research articles</h4>

<h3>Manuscript Preparation</h3>
<p>Manuscripts should be typed and double-spaced. The pages should be numbered consecutively, starting with the title page and through the text, reference list, tables and figure legends. The manuscript should be ordered as follows: Title page, abstract, key words, text, acknowledgements, references, tables, figure legends (on separate page preceding the first figure), figures (one figure per page; the figures should be labelled). The title page should contain Title, Authors, Affiliations, and Corresponding author and address. The <strong>title</strong> should be brief, specific and amenable to indexing. Not more than five <strong>keywords</strong> should be indicated separately; these should be chosen carefully and must not be phrases of several words. <strong>Abstract</strong> and <strong>summary</strong> should be limited to 100 words and convey the main points of the paper, outline the results and conclusions, and explain the significance of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> All papers should have a brief introduction. The text should be intelligible to readers in different disciplines and technical terms should be defined. Tables and figures should be referred to in numerical order. All symbols and abbreviations must be defined, and used only when necessary. Superscripts, subscripts and ambiguous characters should be clearly indicated. Units of measure should be metric or, preferably, SI.</p>
<p><strong>Figures:</strong> Line drawings should be roughly twice the final printed size. Photomicrographs and other photographs that require it must have a scale bar, which should be defined clearly in the legend. Primary data should be submitted as far as possible (e.g. actual photographs of electrophoretic gels rather than idealized diagrams). The map of India, if forming a part of the article, must conform to official maps released by the Survey of India, giving reference to the source map. Lettering should be sufficiently large to be clear after reduction to print size.</p>
<p><strong>References</strong> should be numbered in superscript, serially in the order in which they appear, first through the text and then through table and figure legends. References should not include unpublished source materials. The list of References at the end of the text should be in the following format.</p>
