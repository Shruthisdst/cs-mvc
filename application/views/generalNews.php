				The domain part of the email address of all email addresses used by the office of Indian Academy of Sciences, including those of the staff, the journals, various programmes, and Current Science, has changed from 'ias.ernet.in' (or 'academy.ias .ernet.in') to 'ias.ac.in'. Thus, for example, the address office@ias. ernet.in (or office@academy. ias.ernet.in) has changed to office@ias.ac.in (without the string 'academy'). Please take note of this change.
